# Test particle simulator

A tool for anyalysing single particle trajectories 

## Features
1) Single particle simulation (boris method)
2) Set E and B fields manually
3) Load E and B fields from EMSES data
4) Multiple interacting dust dynamics simulation (verlet method) !!Has memory leak will fix when i have time?

The simulator uses jit compilation for speed.
